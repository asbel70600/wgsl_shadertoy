# About
The objective of this app is to serve as a playground/previewer for wgsl
shadercode. The flow being prepared right now is:
1. Create your shader
2. Run the app with the shader file as argument
3. Edit your shader while the shader updates interactively. 

The idea is for it to offer a lot of uniforms like size of screen, time
date, support for camera movements and such. For now, it just works as a basic
shadertoy to implement ray marching algorithms. Eventually, you'll be able to
apply whatever you want to 3D models.
